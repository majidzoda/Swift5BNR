Create a copy of your MonsterTown project, as you will continue to
work on it in the next chapter and do not want your challenge
solutions to get in the way.
 
There is currently a bug in the program. If a Zombie terrorizes a
Town with a population less than 10, then the town's population
will become negative. This result does not make sense. Fix this bug
by changing the changePopulation(by:) method on Town to never have
a negative population. That is, make sure that a townâ€™s population
is set to 0 if the amount to decrement is greater than the current
population.
