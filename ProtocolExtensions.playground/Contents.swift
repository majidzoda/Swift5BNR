Chapter22: Protocol Extensions - Bronze Challenge p. 521
Add a method called count(where:) to all collections to count the number of elements that pass a provided test.

You should be able to call it like this:
    let workouts: [Exercise] = [ellipticalWorkout, runningWorkout, tenKRun]
    let hardWorkoutCount = workouts.count(where: { $0.caloriesBurned >= 500})   // 1

Look at the documentation for the Sequence and Collection protocols. Why is Collection the better protocol to add this extension to?

Chapter22: Protocol Extension - Silver Challenge p. 522
Sometimes you have a sequence of integers and want to add them up. You can do that by calling reduce(_:_:), but that is ugly and
counterintuitive. (Feel free to take time to review the reduce(_:_:) method in ChapterÂ 13 on closures.)
 
To make summing sequences of number more convenient, add a computed property called sum to all sequences of numbers. You should be able to use
it like this:
    [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].sum       // 108
    [80.5, 9.6].sum                  // 90.1
 
To solve this challenge, you will need to be able to answer a deeper question: What is a number? Look at the documentation for the Int and
Double types. What protocols do they conform to? What protocols do those protocols inherit from? Do Int and Double have any protocols in common
that would be a good place to add your extension?
